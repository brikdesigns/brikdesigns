# CSV vs DB Gap Audit

Generated: 2026-05-24. Source of truth: Webflow CSV exports in `content/csv/`; DB schema from `src/types/supabase.ts` (project `lmhzpzobdkstzpvsqest`).

**Legend:** ✓ = column present in DB with matching semantics | ~ = partial match (different shape, single vs many, or split across columns) | ✗ = no DB home

## Services.csv → `services`

CSV headers: `Name, Slug, Collection ID, Locale ID, Item ID, Archived, Draft, Created On, Updated On, Published On, Description, Tagline, Related, Primary Badge, Secondary Badge, Image, Service Line, Offerings, E-Commerce Products [IGNORE], Not Included in support plan, Support Plan, Rank, Is featured service, Has customer story, Has multiple offerings, Has maintenance add-on`

| CSV column | DB state | Note |
|---|---|---|
| Name | ✓ | `services.name` |
| Slug | ✓ | `services.slug` |
| Collection ID | ✗ | Webflow CMS metadata; no DB column |
| Locale ID | ✗ | Webflow CMS metadata; no DB column |
| Item ID | ✗ | Webflow CMS metadata; no DB column |
| Archived | ~ | Approximated by `services.active` (bool) — no explicit archived flag |

| Description | ✓ | `services.description` |
| Tagline | ✓ | `services.tagline` |
| Related | ~ | `services.related_service_slug` (single text slug); CSV holds many related refs — only one is persisted |
